Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, has garnered global attention for its role in climate change. As part of international sustainability efforts, Saudi Aramco aims to reduce its environmental footprint. This project, conducted as part of the Nanyang Technological University Business School Coursework, serves as a Proof of Concept for Aramco.

**### Objectives**
The project utilizes data-driven predictive modeling to address methane emissions effectively. Employing statistical analysis and advanced modeling techniques, we forecast emissions and propose actionable reduction steps.
The statistical analysis and modeling technique includes linear regression, logistic regression, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and random forest.  

**### Three-Tiered Approach**
**Assessing Acceptability**: Benchmarking predicted emission levels against industry standards.

**Tackling Significant Variables**: Identifying and strategizing actions to address key contributing factors.

**Scenario Testing**: Utilizing predictive models to optimize emission reduction strategies.

**### Key Findings**
Technological upgrades, maintenance of older infrastructure, and efficient equipment deployment are critical to reducing methane emissions.

**### Proposed Solution**
Our solution aims to position Aramco as a leader in sustainable energy practices, ensuring compliance with global standards. By lowering emissions, Aramco may reduce its cost of capital, enhancing shareholder value.

**### Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the synergy between environmental sustainability and economic success. By actively addressing methane emissions, Aramco contributes to global climate efforts while improving its financial outlook.
