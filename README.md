# BC2406-Analytics-I-Visual-Predictive-Techniques
This project, conducted as part of the Nanyang Technological University Business School Coursework, centers on Sustainable Methane Management in Oil and Gas Operations. It serves as a Proof of Concept for Saudi Aramco.

In this repository, you'll find the project report (in .pdf), an R script containing our modeling and results (in .R), and the cleaned dataset used for analytics purposes (in .csv). While the Proof of Concept was tailored for Saudi Aramco, it's important to note that the project presentation was made internally to the course lecturers and coordinator.

This project was done by 4 Year 2 Business Analytics students, Chan Kit Ho, Tan Jirong, Tan Yi Hong and Justinian Santos.
